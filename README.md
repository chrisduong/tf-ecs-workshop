- Build the simple golang HTTP server which return its version.
- Create the ECS cluster.
- Deploy the backend service in ECS.

## Develop the HTTP server

**Requirements:**

About Versioning: we will have a Git tag for each release.

```sh
VERSION=v0.1.0 make build
```

Run the docker image locally:

```sh
docker run --rm -it -p 8080:8080  http-server:0.1.0
```

## Setup the Infra

**Requirements**:

- Terraform version `> 1.0'.
- Community Terraform modules:
  - [aws-ecs](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/terraform-aws-modules/ecs/aws/latest)
  - [aws-alb](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/terraform-aws-modules/alb/aws/latest)

terraform workspace select dev
terraform validate
terraform apply -auto-approve
```
